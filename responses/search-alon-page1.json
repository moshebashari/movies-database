It aired on SBS from April 3 to May 23, 2006 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes.\n\nThe ratings it received were not very high, but the series won acclaim for its subtle and realistic portrayal of love, marriage and divorce. The story follows Eun-ho and Dong-jin, two ordinary people - not particularly attractive or successful - as they come to terms with their relationship. Although already divorced for three years, they are unable to leave each other alone, persistently meeting, bickering, and offering support, comfort, even matchmaking for the other. The two seem destined to be together, but they are unwilling to face their past and confront the tragedy they have spent years trying to forget.\n\nIt was based on the Japanese novel Love Generation by Hisashi Nozawa, which was published in 1996 and won the 4th Shimase Literary Prize for Romance in 1997. The Korean adaptation was written by Park Yeon-seon. This was the first TV series directed by film director Han Ji-seung.",
